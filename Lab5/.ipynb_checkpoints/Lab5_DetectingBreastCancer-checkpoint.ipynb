    "Doctors at the Wash U Medical School need your help in finding a fast, reliable method of detecting the malignancy of breast cancer tumors for their patients. Thankfully, Dr. William H. Wolberg from the University of Wisconsin has provided a dataset of hundreds of `benign` and `malignant` cases at their hospital. By the end of this lab, you will know how to build an accurate classification model to perform this task. We will begin by revising and implementing the logistic regression classifier and then train and test it on the breast cancer dataset. For evaluation we will introduce some new metrics that are specific to classification. "

    "\n",
    "Before we start we'll apply the trick of consolidating the mdoel parameters $b$ and $w$ as was described in lecture. In our discussions so far we have represented models with the general formula: $$y = wx + b.$$ In this representation, we notate $w$ and $b$ as distinct entities with separate names. However, it is also very common to see all of a models parameters referred to as a single unit called $\\theta$, $\\beta$, or $w$, amongst other names, depending on the context.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a valid thing to do because the bias or constant term $b$ is really just another parameter of the model. Practically, however, this means that we will need to change the way we define $w$ and $X$ in order to keep the math straight.\n",

    "\n",
    "Accordingly, we must also adjust $X$ in order to keep the math (via dot product) consistent. We can do this by adding a $1$ to each observation so that for each data point, $x_i$, we have $$x_i = [1, x_{i, 0}, x_{i, 1}, \\ldots, x_{i, d}].$$\n",
